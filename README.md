# SDN Multipath Using RYU Controller

Based on implementation in https://github.com/wildan2711/multipath . 2 year ago, i try to upgrade the implementation with algorithm that update the path used to send data according to the incoming traffic.

The algorithm that i use is :

If the incoming traffic is big, then the data will be send with multiple path.
Then, if the incoming traffic is small, then the data will be send using a single path.

This git is only for archive purpose only.
